# Data Mining Project - Prediction of Customer Repurchase

This repository contains the code, dataset, and LaTeX report for a data mining project conducted as part of Data Mining course. The project follows the IEEE Conference template and covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and experimental results.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Objective**: Building a predictive model that can forecast the likelihood and timing of a product replenishment for individual customers based on historical purchase data and product information.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes transactions.csv, which records individual customer purchases with details like customer_id, product_id, purchase_date, and quantity. Supporting files include product_catalog.csv (detailed product attributes), product_category_map.csv (hierarchical product categorization), and test.csv (a sample submission format for predictions).
- **Methods Used**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, encoding)
  - Feature engineering
  - Machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor)
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, confusion matrix)
